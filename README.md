Implement a command interpreter. Introduce a set of commands that are accepted during a command-interpreter session. The effect of each command can vary with the application. Two special command names are Quit and Undo. These must be accepted. Quit stops the session. Undo removes commands from the history of executed commands in reverse chronological order. It notifies the user of the name of the undone command. The number of executed commands is thus decremented.
